1.) Capstone Analytics Project (This Presentation Slidedeck depicts a group analysis project focused on assisting Ontario Tech University with optimizing student commute efficiency for students. With the help of Excel, PowerBI, Google Maps API, and Python, we were able to extract relevant insights and determine a final solution that complements an 11-minute reduction in student wait times. 

2.) Crowdfunding Analysis (This project entails organizing and analyzing a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover hidden trends that contribute to their success in meeting or exceeding initial funding goals. 

3.) Pharmaceutical Analysis (The purpose of this task is to thoroughly study 249 mice and their reactions to various drug treatments for skin cancer. The analysis is organized into tasks such as: DATA PREPARATION, SUMMARY STATISTICS, DATA VISUALIZATION, OUTLIER IDENTIFICATION, AND REGRESSION/COEFFICIENT ANALYSIS. To conclude, it is crucial to extract relevant insights and analyze these treatments for skin cancer by first testing on mice.

4.) WeatherPy (The goal is to utilize the Weather API to analyze and compare various weather metrics for analytical purposes.)
